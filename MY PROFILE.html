        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Gabriel Abiera, born on April 27, 2009, in Iloilo City. I am a simple person who dreams of finishing my studies, getting a decent job, and helping my family and siblings.

Since childhood, I have grown up surrounded by the love of my family. They taught me to respect elders and instilled in me the importance of education, hard work, and determination. I enjoy playing online games, especially Mobile Legends. I play during my free time, often with my friends. Playing online games helps me relieve stress and forget my problems. Aside from that, I also love solving math problems and listening to music.

My dream is to become an engineer and support my family in the future. With every step I take in life, I carry my faith in God and the lessons my parents have taught me. These serve as my guide and motivation in reaching my dreams.

My pre-school life was amazing. I studied at Delegate Angel Salazar Jr. Memorial School, where I met many friends who remain close to me until now. My elementary days were filled with fun; we often played different games like "Clever Clever," and most of the time, I would win. Elementary school was challenging, but I managed to finish it with the help of my family and friends. I was quite mischievous, but I still studied hard because I knew my parents would discipline me if I didnâ€™t.

My high school life was a bit boring at first, but everything changed when I met a beautiful girl. She was amazing and became my inspiration to study hard and become the best version of myself every day. She was always there for me through my ups and downs. Sometimes we had arguments, but we always resolved our problems together. I also have friends, some of whom were my classmates in elementary school. It is sad to think that this is our last year together in one classroom, but I hope we will remain friends even if we are no longer classmates. I also wish that one day, we will see each other again as successful individuals in life.</p>
